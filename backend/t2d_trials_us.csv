2. The index case and at least one other affected sibling who has diabetes and renal disease, or
3. The index case and at least one unaffected sibling, defined as an individual who has had diabetes for at least 10 years and who has no renal disease (based on evidence obtained from the medical record and from the FIND examination.",18 Years,99 Years,ALL,True,,OBSERVATIONAL,"The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) is a multicenter study designed to identify genetic determinants of diabetic kidney disease. FIND will be conducted in eleven centers and in many ethnic groups throughout the United States. Two different strategies will be used to localize genes predisposing to kidney disease: a family-based genetic linkage study and a case-control study that utilizes admixture linkage disequilibrium. The center based at the Phoenix office of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK-Phoenix) will conduct family-based linkage studies among American Indian populations in the southwestern United States.

Participants (index cases) with diabetes and kidney disease will initially be recruited, and their parents and siblings will also be invited to participate. Genetic material from these participants will be used to genotype markers throughout the genome. Linkage analysis will be conducted to identify particular chromosomal regions containing genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease. Linkage analyses will also be used to identify genes influencing traits related to diabetic kidney disease, such as serum creatinine, urinary protein excretion, plasma glucose levels, blood pressure and blood lipid levels. Regions that show evidence for linkage will then be examined in more detail, with both genetic linkage and association studies, to attempt to identify the specific genes that influence diabetic kidney disease, or related traits.

The identification of genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease will lead to a better understanding of how kidney disease develops. In the long run, this may lead to improved treatment and prevention of diabetic kidney disease."

* Features of at least moderate acute alcohol intoxication at screening, per treating team.",18 Years,,ALL,False,"PHASE1, PHASE2",INTERVENTIONAL,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is increasingly recognized in adults with ""ketone-prone"" type 2 diabetes. In many of these patients, the pancreas can still make insulin but becomes temporarily ""stunned"" during severe, prolonged high blood sugar. Arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid that can trigger the pancreas to release its own insulin when glucose is high. It is FDA-approved for other uses and has been given intravenously for decades with a strong safety record. Whether a single arginine infusion given early during DKA can safely boost the body's insulin and speed recovery has not been tested.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial will enroll 60 adults who present to one of four Detroit-area emergency departments with DKA consistent with ketone-prone type 2 diabetes (high glucose and significant ketones). Participants will receive standard DKA care ordered by their clinicians. In addition, under blinded conditions they will receive either arginine hydrochloride 30 grams (in 300 mL) or placebo (normal saline), infused intravenously over 30 minutes as early as feasible after DKA is recognized.

The main question is whether arginine increases endogenous (self-made) insulin soon after infusion. We will measure C-peptide (a marker released in equal amounts with insulin) and glucose at 10, 30, and 90 minutes after the start of the infusion and calculate the C-peptide/glucose ratio. Secondary measures include the rate of ketone (β-hydroxybutyrate) clearance and the total insulin dose required in the first 24 hours. Additional blood tests will examine arginine and related amino acids, and a small sample of platelets will be used to explore mitochondrial function. Safety will be closely monitored during and after the infusion, and participants will be contacted at 90 days to assess for any delayed problems.

Potential risks include temporary flushing, nausea, or headache; the infusion can be stopped at any time if needed. Potential benefits include faster resolution of ketosis and reduced insulin needs, but benefits cannot be guaranteed for individual participants."

Exclusion Criteria:

* Contra-indications according to the local label.",18 Years,,ALL,False,,OBSERVATIONAL,"This is an observational study in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) who will be receiving finerenone.

Kidneys filter extra water and waste out of the blood and make urine. CKD is a long-term, progressive, decrease in the kidneys' ability to filter the blood properly. In people with T2D, the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin, or does not use insulin well enough, resulting in high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to the kidneys. As a result, CKD can occur as a complication of T2D.

Finerenone works by blocking certain proteins, called mineralocorticoid receptors. An increased stimulation of these proteins is thought to damage the kidneys and the heart. By lowering their stimulation, finerenone reduces the risk of kidney disease progressively getting worse.

Finerenone is available and approved for doctors to prescribe to people with CKD and T2D. Since it has only recently become available for these patients, there is a need for more information about the use of finerenone in the real-world setting.

The main purpose of the study is to learn more about treatment patterns in people with CKD and T2D who just started or will start finerenone treatment as decided and prescribed by their doctor as part of their routine medical care.

To answer this question, the researchers will collect data on:

* Clinical characteristics (e.g., history of CKD and T2D, blood pressure, heart health) of the participants
* Reasons for starting finerenone
* Reasons for stopping finerenone early
* How long participants have been taking finerenone (planned by their doctor compared to actual time it was taken)
* Dosing of finerenone
* Other medications used while taking finerenone

The researchers will also collect data on medical problems (called adverse events) that the participants may have during the study. All adverse events are collected, even if they might not be related to the study treatment.

Hyperkalemia, a medical term used to describe a potassium level in the blood that is higher than normal, is of special interest when finerenone is combined with some medications commonly taken to control blood pressure. Researchers want to know how often higher potassium levels occur, and when it leads to:

* Stopping finerenone treatment too early
* Dialysis (a medical procedure to filter the blood of extra water and waste)
* Care in a hospital

All data will come from medical records or from interviews study doctors will have with the participants during visits that take place during routine medical care.

Participants in the US will be invited to provide voluntary blood and urine samples that could be analyzed later to better understand possible changes in protein or nucleic acid levels over time.

Each participant will be in the study for 12 months. This time participating in the study may be shorter if their finerenone treatment is stopped early or the study comes to an end as planned in September 2027."

The participants in this study are already receiving the study treatment finerenone as part of their regular care from their doctors. In observational studies, only observations are made without specified advice or interventions. CKD is a long-term progressive decrease in the kidneys' ability to work properly. In people with T2D, the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin, or does not use insulin well enough. The resulting high blood sugar levels can cause damage to the kidneys. CKD often occurs together with T2D or as a consequence of T2D. Finerenone works by blocking certain proteins, called mineralocorticoid receptors. By doing this, it may reduce damage to kidneys, heart and blood vessels. Finerenone was recently approved in the US and is now available for doctors to prescribe to people with CKD together with T2D. Consequently, there is a need to collect more information about how finerenone is used, its safety and how well it works under real-world conditions. The main purpose of this study is to collect and describe the characteristics of people with CKD and T2D who are receiving initiate finerenone treatment as prescribed by their doctors. To do this, the researchers will collect general information of the participants such as age or gender and data on kidney function and possible heart problems.

It integrates medical and social care by embedding a data-driven triage tool within the EPIC electronic health record system, engaging community health workers trained in population health, and initiating closed-loop EPIC integrated referrals to community-based organizations.

This study will use a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial design to evaluate the implementation of the THRIVE-DM intervention at the clinic level. Preliminary effectiveness will be assessed by comparing THRIVE-DM to usual care in its ability to increase patient connections to community-based organizations and improve clinical outcomes. Using a stratified randomization approach, the investigators will compare referral closure rates, receipt of social services, hemoglobin A1C levels, and patterns of health service utilization between patients enrolled in THRIVE-DM and those receiving standard care"

Added fructose has been shown to have an adverse impact on metabolic health, including increased insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. However, the mechanisms that link dietary fructose and metabolic health are poorly understood. Malabsorption or incomplete metabolism of fructose in the small intestine is common in the population. Excess fructose reaches the colon where it may change the structure and function of the gut microbiome, alter bacterial metabolites and trigger inflammatory responses impacting T2D risk. To elucidate whether commonly consumed levels of dietary fructose influence metabolic outcomes through altering the gut microbiome, the research team will randomize 30 participants to a controlled cross-over dietary intervention, in which the participants will consume 12-day isocaloric, added fructose or glucose diets (25% of total calories) separated by a 10-day controlled diet washout period.

The research team aims to:

1. Determine the relationships between high fructose consumption, the gut microbiome and metabolic risk.
2. Characterize the causal role(s) that fructose-induced alterations to the gut microbiome have on metabolic risk using a germ-free mouse model.

The research team will measure 1) microbiota community structure and function via metagenomic sequencing of stool, 2) fecal metabolites via targeted and untargeted metabolomics, 3) anthropometrics, 4) insulin resistance, serum markers of T2D risk and inflammatory cytokines, 5) fecal microbial carbohydrate oxidation capacity and 6) liver fat via MRI elastography. The research team will use novel statistical approaches, including Distributed Lag Modeling, to understand the complex relationships between diet, the microbiome, metabolites and health outcomes.

The research team will then conduct controlled dietary interventions and fecal microbiome transplantation studies in germ-free mice. Donor fecal samples from human participants in both the glucose and fructose arms of the clinical intervention will be transplanted into germ-free and colonized mice to establish a causal relationship between fructose-induced changes to the gut microbiome, liver fat and metabolic and inflammatory changes known to increase risk for T2D.

The research team aims to comprehensively assess the structural and functional changes to the gut microbiome brought about by a high fructose diet. Determining the impact of excess fructose on the microbiome will help identify novel means by which fructose contributes to metabolic disease risk. In addition to identifying strategies to improve metabolic health in adults, data from this proposal could help inform targeted approaches to mitigate future disease risk in vulnerable populations that consume high levels of fructose, such as children."

The investigators are interested in better understanding the way that this drug affects the metabolism and hormone levels of a person with MODY. Many people with MODY report having gastrointestinal (GI) issues such as an upset stomach. Investigators also are interested in finding out if this drug will help with GI issues.

If liraglutide does help with this symptom of MODY, the investigators want to know why this happens. If this drug is effective for participants, the investigators will use participants cells to make human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC). This means that the investigators will use participant cells to create what are called stem cells, which are cells in the body that are able to be told what their job is.

Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB."

The investigators acknowledge that sulfonylureas are inexpensive and that their low cost is a driver of continued use. However, the investigators believe patients and providers should have discussions about the risks of sulfonylureas and safer and more effective alternatives, to make diabetes care safer overall in ambulatory settings. Our research is designed to promote such discussions. The investigators will first identify patients taking sulfonylureas regularly. Next, using recommendations from AHRQ and the Canadian Deprescribing Network, the investigators will empower patients to discuss their medications with their providers through a simple question prompt sheet. Patients will be divided into an intervention group which receives explicit prompting questions, and a control group that receives a general brochure on diabetes medications. Health care providers will receive education about newer diabetes medications through case-based discussions and academic detailing. Finally the investigators will measure key outcomes including the proportion of patients who have discussions about sulfonylureas and alternatives, rates of discontinuation, and measures of control of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risks. The investigators will also evaluate the experiences of patients and providers qualitatively through brief, semi-structured interviews. Should our multi-faceted, patient-oriented intervention prove effective in promoting discussions of sulfonylureas and alternatives, and also discontinuation of sulfonylureas and switching to newer alternatives, the investigators will incorporate our prompting questions into routine care for patients taking sulfonylureas. Our intervention can be easily disseminated to other settings and therefore has considerable potential to improve safety among patients with type 2 diabetes nationwide."

Disparities in T2D are driven in part by independent, modifiable risk factors including low levels of physical activity, sleep, and poor diet. Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone for maintaining glucose control and managing T2D. However, few studies have developed and tested lifestyle interventions for Hispanic youth with T2D. Digital health interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behaviors like physical activity, sleep, and diet, have demonstrated effectiveness among adults. Studies that use health-based smartphone applications have demonstrated preliminary efficacy for improving health-related lifestyle behaviors as these digital tools leverage behavior change techniques (e.g. self-monitoring, goal-setting, feedback) that have proven effective. Use of digital technology allows for the continuous delivery of intervention content into the home environment extending the reach of clinical care while engaging youth in a format that is age-appropriate given that today's youth are digital frontrunners. Unfortunately, while the use of digital health interventions have increased, few studies have focused on adolescents with overweight and obesity who are at high risk for T2D. The purpose of this study is to 1) develop a mobile health platform for remote and continuous monitoring of activity, sleep, and nutrition and 2) conduct a pilot study (30 days) to evaluate the efficacy of a novel digital health platform in improving obesity-related health outcomes outcomes in Hispanic adolescents (12-18 years; N=30) population."

Ischemic leg pain drives disability in PAD patients and results from oxygen supply-demand mismatch, autonomic dysfunction, and muscle breakdown. This leg pain, which is unresponsive to traditional pharmacotherapy, limits the patient's tolerance to exercise, which is an important disease-modifying intervention. Spinal cord stimulation is a well-established therapy for medically intractable pain, including painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) and ischemic pain, but is not part of the standard-of-care for PAD despite limited promising clinical data. Early studies used first-generation, tonic stimulation devices, but with these it was impossible to perform sham-controlled trials to test the treatment. Since then, new types of waveform treatments, including high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been shown to be more effective in the treatment of intractable pain. While high-frequency SCS is approved for PDN treatment, it has never been tested in the treatment of claudication pain from PAD.

This study will enroll up to 15 participants between the ages of 19 and 89 who have PAD and PDN and are successfully implanted with a permanent SCS. Twelve weeks after SCS implantation, participants will receive two weeks of stimulation and two weeks of sham intervention, in random starting order. Blood flow, blood pressure, skin oxygen levels, and participant reported pain int the lower extremities will be assessed before SCS implantation, 12 weeks after SCS implantation and during each of the treatment periods.

These effects are more pronounced in people with early type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in keeping with increased expression of PC-1/3 and GLP-1 that is observed in diabetic islets. However, its regulation is at present unknown. There is evidence that α-cell proglucagon processing is subject to paracrine regulation by the β-cell3. It is unclear if the effects of GLP1R agonism on islet GLP-1 differ in Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared to T2DM. This experiment will examine the effect of glycemic control ± a GLP1R agonist on islet GLP-1 in people with (T2DM) and without (T1DM) β-cells."

Unfortunately, a paucity of literature exists on interventions aimed at improving CVH among Black men. The team of clinician scientists and community partners co-developed a community-based lifestyle intervention titled Black Impact: a 24-week intervention for Black men with less-than-ideal CVH (\<4 LS7 metrics in the ideal range) with 45 minutes of weekly physical activity, 45 minutes of weekly health education, and engagement with a health coach, group fitness trainer, and community health worker.

Secondary outcomes included improvements in psychosocial stress (i.e., perceived stress, depressive symptoms), patient activation, and social needs. Thus, robustly powered clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of Black Impact and to evaluate the underlying interpersonal and molecular pathways by which Black Impact improves psychosocial stress and CVH. Thus, the investigators propose a randomized, wait-list controlled trial of Black Impact. This novel, community-based intervention to provide a scalable model to improve CVH and psychosocial stress at the population level and evaluate the biological underpinnings by which the intervention mitigates cardiovascular disease risk.

In particular, they have higher rates of diabetes-related complications and other related conditions such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, neuropathy, and the risk of amputation. Diabetes affects 34 million adults in the US. Achieving a target HbA1c less than 8% can be challenging through diabetes management. Patients are able to monitor their blood glucose levels with devices such as blood glucose meters or continuous glucose monitors to facilitate diabetes management and glycemic control. Past studies have demonstrated that these devices are effective in engaging patients in the improvement of diabetes management. Current advancements in remote patient monitoring and self-monitoring have been observed to be effective in facilitating improvement in diabetes outcomes. However, the effectiveness and financial feasibility of these devices delivered in conjunction with automated patient engagement systems in remote patient monitoring programs is not well understood among underinsured, underserved, and vulnerable minority populations as they face a high-cost barrier particularly with continuous glucose monitors. To better address this gap in knowledge, this pilot study will compare and examine the effectiveness of these interventions on patient outcomes with Type 2 diabetes among populations in the West Side of Chicago. Study the comparative effectiveness among patients with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes on insulin in an intervention group using remote patient monitoring and automated patient engagement system with blood glucose monitors to a group using a self-monitoring program with continuous glucose monitors and a usual care group receiving standard care.

Though numerous factors affect these disparities, one modifiable risk factor may be that of binge eating (BE), which increases risk for binge-eating disorder (BED), which is associated with severe obesity, and often precedes a T2DM diagnosis, beginning in childhood or adolescence. Nearly 30% of Black women with obesity report binge eating episodes. Furthermore, given that binge and overeating may disparately increase the odds of obesity in Black adults (15-fold increase vs. 6-fold increase in White adults), reducing this behavior will be critical to prevent continued disparities in T2DM diagnosis. Given that Black women have the highest rates of obesity in the nation (57%), report disparate rates of weight gain between young adulthood and mid adulthood, and report disparate rates of emotional eating in adolescence, which is a risk factor for BE, one pathway to reducing disparities in T2DM risk in Black women may be to reduce binge eating and prevent weight gain in emerging adulthood (ages 18-25)."

Typically, 30-60 min bouts of PA are advocated per day. Although this approach increases PA, it does not decrease the length of the sedentary periods through the day. This is important because recent epidemiological data suggest that frequently interrupting sedentary time improves glucose control even in people who achieve the recommended levels of PA. Preliminary experimental data suggest that breaking up prolonged sedentary time by performing multiple short bouts (5 min) of PA throughout the day, may improve glycemia more than performing a single continuous bout of PA, and thereby potentially be a novel strategy to prevent T2D. The improvement in glycemia was observed even when the total amount of PA and total energy expenditure were matched, suggesting that how and when PA is performed over the day may matter more than how much PA is done. However, important gaps in knowledge remain including: (1) whether similar benefits on glucose control would be observed in adults with prediabetes, a clinically relevant population that is at high risk of developing T2D; (2) whether these effects are sustained or diluted over time, and (3) what are the mechanistic underpinnings. To address these gaps, the investigators propose to measure the acute and chronic effects of PA breaks on glucose control and the underlying mechanisms in individuals at risk of developing T2D. Sedentary men and women with prediabetes (n=66, 50% F) will be randomized to either an intervention designed to interrupt SB with 5-min bouts of brisk walking performed hourly for 9 hours/day, 5 days/week (BREAK) or a control condition consisting of 45-min of brisk walking performed as a single daily continuous bout, 5 days/week (ONE).

The injured beta cells can then no longer make the needed amount of insulin to stay healthy. However, in the early stages of T1D, some beta cells are still alive and functioning. Treatment to protect the beta cells against injury at this time could slow the progress of disease. Denosumab is an approved treatment for osteoporosis (a disease that thins and weakens the bones), high blood calcium levels, bone cancer, and other bone problems in patients who have cancer. The research team has found that the bone pathway that denosumab works on to treat these bone conditions also has effects on the health of the beta cells. Lab studies suggest that denosumab may protect and/or increase the number of beta cells and improve how well they work. This study will test whether denosumab is safe and improves beta cell function and blood sugar control in people with early T1D."

Yet many nutrition plans fail to account for interpersonal variability in blood glucose response to meals. This diminishes the ability of dietary interventions to optimize glycemic control and may lessen patient satisfaction, self--efficacy, and adherence. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can facilitate behavior change in type 2 diabetes and has been associated with improved outcomes in nutrition intervention studies; this literature is limited by small study sample sizes and heterogeneity of study design and outcomes, and more data are needed. CGM could be a powerful tool for adapting a nutrition plan based on blood glucose response at an individual level. This study will test the use of CGM to personalize nutrition therapy compared to nutrition therapy alone (without CGM) for participants with type 2 diabetes who are not meeting glycemic treatment goals."

This study will evaluate the role of the intestine in the beneficial metabolic effects of gastric bypass surgery. It specifically will examine whether the intestine increases its metabolism and its activity, and whether this results in an increase in fuel utilization. Thirty two (32) subjects will be recruited (18 with and 14 without Type 2 Diabetes). At the time of gastric bypass surgery, a small piece of intestine that is usually discarded will be collected. At three time points over the first year after surgery, intestinal samples will be obtained by endoscopy or insertion of a lighted flexible tube through the mouth.

T2DM is currently the 6th leading cause of mortality in the United States and is a major cause of kidney failure, blindness, amputations, heart attack, and other vascular and gastro-intestinal dysfunctions. Traditionally, treatments include intensive lifestyle modifications with or without glucose lowering agents. Neither treatment alone, or in combination, results in complete resolution of diabetes and its potential long-term complications. Bariatric surgery has been proven as an effective treatment to accomplish sustained and significant weight loss for those with severe obesity and has been shown to induce long-term remission of T2DM. However, despite enthusiasm for these potential treatment options, it is not clear whether diabetes is influenced by the type of surgery or by the amount of weight lost or if bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical weight loss induced by diet and physical activity in T2DM patients with moderate BMIs (30-40kg/m2; Class I and Class II obesity, or approximately 65-95 pounds overweight depending on your height). More well-controlled studies are needed to more completely inform health care decision making and clinical practice in this area.

This interventional study aims to assess whether training healthcare professionals (HCPs) increases the number of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) prescriptions for patients with Type 2 Diabetes in a Federally Qualified Health Center serving a predominantly Hispanic/Latino population.

Research Questions:

Does HCP training enhance CGM prescription rates in a primary care setting? Does receiving a CGM prescription lead to improved Type 2 Diabetes control, as measured by Hemoglobin A1c levels? What barriers do patients face when prescribed and using CGMs? Given the significant impact of CGMs on diabetes management, this project seeks to improve CGM utilization among eligible patients through a focused intervention for HCPs and evaluate diabetes outcomes for those who do and do not receive a CGM.

Methodology:

HCPs and staff from three clinics within the same healthcare system will undergo a brief, in-person training on current clinical guidelines and insurance eligibility for CGMs. A booster session will follow about one month later to reinforce learning and address any prescribing challenges.

Training efficacy will be evaluated by comparing CGM prescription rates before and after training using electronic health records. HCPs will complete pre- and post-training surveys to assess changes in knowledge, beliefs, and prescribing practices related to CGMs. Additionally, a small subset of prescribers will participate in interviews about their experiences with CGM prescriptions four months post-training.

Patient Recruitment and Surveys:

Patients with Type 2 Diabetes will be recruited for surveys at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months. These surveys will gather information on their diabetes management experience, levels of diabetes distress, and whether CGM discussions occurred with their primary care provider. Participants who received CGM prescriptions will share their experiences and any barriers encountered. A subset will also be invited for interviews to further explore their CGM experiences.

Conclusion:

This study seeks to fill a crucial gap in understanding how HCP training influences CGM prescription rates and the associated diabetes management outcomes, ultimately aiming to enhance diabetes care for a vulnerable population."

People with diabetes have an increased risk of heart disease, heart failure, and death from a cardiovascular cause. Diabetes prevents efficient metabolism of fuel, causes inflammation and vascular disease that blocks normal blood flow, and inhibits the function of the heart after injury. These changes make diabetics more susceptible to heart attacks and heart failure.

Resveratrol is found in grapes and red wine and has been shown to have beneficial effects in diabetic patients. In previous studies the investigators have shown that resveratrol can improve heart metabolism and function in pigs with diabetes and chronic lack of blood flow to the heart.

Questions

The investigators believe resveratrol will help reverse the negative effects of diabetes on the heart. The questions are: 1.How does the molecular machinery in the hearts of patients with diabetes differ from patients without diabetes? 2.Will resveratrol have an effect on heart metabolism, intracellular signaling, inflammation and blood vessel function? 3.Will resveratrol improve the number and function of cardiac stem cells, cells involved in heart repair? The investigators have been safely collecting tissue from the hearts of patients undergoing heart surgery. Preliminary studies show the investigators can isolate and study cells. The investigators have collected and assessed the function of endothelial cells, a measure of vascular health and can measure the level of endothelial injury and have studied the make-up of caveolae, structures on the cell membrane that are important for cell signaling and are negatively impacted by diabetes. This study is a unique collaboration among cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and basic scientists."

A randomized cross-over trial be used to compare resistance exercise at two different times of the day. Each condition will take place in a laboratory setting. Each condition will consist of exercise, overnight sleep, and oral glucose tolerance tests the following day. The AM exercise will occur \~1.5 hours after habitual wake, and PM exercise will occur \~11 hours after habitual wake. After a 2-6 week washout, participants will complete the other condition. The hypothesis is that PM exercise will be more beneficial than AM exercise in improving insulin sensitivity.

Recent studies from HIV-negative subjects have identified several associations between circulating immune cell populations and impaired glucose tolerance, including increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced regulatory T cells. Of note, these same changes in peripheral T cell subsets are frequently observed in patients with chronic HIV infection. The goal of this study is to assess whether the circulating T cell distribution is reflective of the adipose tissue T cell distribution, and to understand whether chronic adipose tissue T cell activation may impair adipocyte (i.e., fat cell) function and insulin sensitivity. If the investigators' hypotheses are correct, this will demonstrate that chronic peripheral immune activation (i.e., high memory T cells, low naïve cells, and increased expression of activation surface markers) is associated with greater adipose-resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expression of activation markers, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance."

Medication mismanagement is one of the most common and concerning risk factors in people with dementia (PwD), as it leads to undertreatment, emergency room visits, hospital admissions/readmissions, and serious adverse events. 3M older U.S. adults are admitted to nursing homes due to drug-related adherence problems with costs \>$14B/year. Furthermore, 30% of hospital admissions of older adults are drug related with 11% attributed to medication non-adherence and 17% to adverse drug reactions. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) \& type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) individually have considerable morbidity \& mortality, they often occur together, worsening adverse outcomes, quality of life, \& care costs. This is especially true as the AD/DM combination creates a complex balancing act of med management \& symptom monitoring in older populations. While the goal is to keep older adults with dementia at home as long as possible, these challenges lead to untold personal \& family suffering, as well as billions in potentially avoidable healthcare costs annually. The HiDO-ALZ platform will solve these challenges by automating medication administration for PwD to eliminate mismanagement, decrease caregiver burden, reduce healthcare utilization, and facilitate PwD to age in place. HiDO is being developed as an automated, AI driven medication dispensing and direct observation platform to optimize adherence. The device integrates medication dispensing, dose administration time, medication synchronization, \& pair of front-facing cameras to validate the right meds, right route, right time, right dosage to the right patient (5R's). Cameras record every dose using facial recognition \& provide real -time medication consumption recordings. Through cloud connectivity, providers \& caregivers have access to video observation logs, dose administration time, adherence trends, \& longitudinal adherence via web dashboard. Patients \& caregivers can easily setup complex medication protocols in minutes using a smartphone app. The device then alerts patients and dispenses up to 7 different types of meds simultaneously, with up to 90 days of medication. Connected data sources including remote blood pressure and weight measurements, as well as electronic health record lab results and videoconferencing integrate in a single dashboard. The project will build on successful Phase I, in which the medication dispensing unit was updated with modifications for dementia, passed all bench testing, and was successfully validated in pilot usability with dementia subjects. Phase II will expand the foundation with four Aims: 1) Enhance device with remote sensors for diabetes management, expanded data integration, and video conferencing, 2) Test enhanced platform for usability in dementia subjects, 3) Transition the design to formal manufacturing process to ensure system meets performance standards and regulatory requirements \& produce pre-production devices for testing, \& 4) Conduct in-home clinical trial to demonstrate adherence and efficacy."

Currently, many hospitals differ among use of insulin for management of DM in pregnancy, with NPH, glargine and detemir being the most commonly used forms of basal insulin. Outside of pregnancy, NPH is rarely used with glargine and determir being the more common forms of insulin used due to their fewer episodes of hypoglycemia in these patients. Detemir has been well studied in pregnancy and found to be noninferior to NPH. Unfortunately, glargine has not been as well studied in pregnancy. Thus, with this study we want to compare glargine and NPH.

The purpose of this study is to compare two different forms of insulin (Glargine and NPH) that we regularly use to manage diabetes mellitus in pregnancy."
